# ATM-bank
I have created an atm bank project along with a database using My SQL.


I am still working on the GUI which will be made with the help of servlets and jsp.


These files which I have uploaded here contains:
        1) A SQL file which contains the code for the table and entries in the database.
        2) A .java file(ConnectToDatabase) which contains the code to set the connection with the database.
        3) A .java file(ATMBank) which contains the code for the all the functionalities of the atm bank.
        4) A .jar file, which will be in the library and it will help in the setting the connection between java and sql files.


You can run the code in your system.
The login details: username: Deepak
                   ,password: HELLO
     
Then you can perform the functionalities:
                                        1) Check Balance
                                        2) Withdraw Money
                                        3) Deposit Money
                                        4) Logout
                                    
Whatever changes you will make while running the code, the data will change in the database accordingly.
THANKYOU!!  :)
